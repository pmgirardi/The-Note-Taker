# The-Note-Taker
 
  ## Description
For this assignment, I modified starter code to create an application called The Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application uses an Express.js back end and will save and retriebe mote data from a JSON file. When a user is opens the Note Taker, they are given a note-taking application and presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. When the user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are then presented with a page that has existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields tp eneter a new note title and the note's text in the right-hand column. When the user enters a new note title and the note's text thenm a save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page. When a user clicks on the Save icon, the new note entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes. When a user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column that note appears in the right-hand column. When a user clicks on the Write icon in the navigation at the top of the page, they will be
presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the noteâ€™s text in the right-hand column.
